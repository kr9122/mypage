Oh, the minions, they dance and play,
With their yellow skin and curious way,
They frolic in the sun all day,
Their laughter echoes far away.

Their masters may come and go,
But the minions remain, you know,
True to themselves, they never stray,
In their own little world, they sway.

With goggles on their eyes so bright,
And overalls that fit just right,
They scurry here and there,
A joyful sight beyond compare.

From Gru to Scarlet, they serve with grace,
Their antics bring us endless space,
Of wonder, magic, and delight,
On this merry minion night.

So let us celebrate these small,
Yet mighty creatures of ball,
For they bring us such joy and cheer,
And fill our hearts with love and light, year by year
